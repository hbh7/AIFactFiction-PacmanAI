## OpenAIGym Setup instructions

### WSL2 (Preferred)

Adapted from https://medium.com/swlh/get-wsl2-working-on-windows-10-2ee84ef8ed43

1. Set up and install WSL2 according to the directions from Microsoft. WSL2 is required I believe as WSL 1 doesn't have necessary functions or something.

2. Install VcXsrv from https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/

3. Install PuTTY

4. Run VcXsrv (likely XLaunch in Windows Start Menu), click next through settings. 

5. Run these commands in WSL: 
    ```
    sudo apt-get remove --purge openssh-server
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    sudo apt-get install -y openssh-server
    ```

6. Edit the SSH server config with `nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

7. Make sure the following lines are uncommented/set:
    ```
    X11Forwarding yes
    X11DisplayOffset 10
    ```

8. Run: `sudo service ssh restart`

9. Open PuTTY, go to `Connection` -> `SSH` -> `X11` and check `Enable X11 forwarding` and set the `X display location` to `127.0.0.1:0.0`.

10. Return to the `Session` tab. Enter `localhost` as the `Host Name`, or optionally (for convenience) add your username, like `username@localhost`.

11. Also for convenience, type a name in `Saved Sessions` like `WSL Local SSH` or something, and press save. This makes it so you don't have to configure PuTTY every time, you can just double click the entry in the sessions list. 

12. Press open (or double click the session you made) and log in with your WSL username/password.

13. Change to the code directory using the `cd` command. This will probably be something like `cd /mnt/c/Users/yourname/Documents/Github/AIFactFiction-PacmanAI`. 

14. Install dependencies:
    ```
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-opengl
    sudo pip3 install gym
    sudo pip3 install gym[atari]
    ```

15. Run the code with `python3 filename.py`.

16. You should now have success! Hopefully anyways

## Notes
* Since the model is built as a function with its weights stored in a dictionary and not a tensorflow model subclass, saving and loading it is implausible. Due to time constraints rewriting it into a tensorflow model subclass (easy), update the training to use the new format (manageable) and debugging the inevitbale issues (hard) is also implausible.
* The penalty fo time spent in a level could not be implemented as OpenAIGym does not return level information
* In order to optimize parameters one variable must be changed at a time and then the model must be retrained. This is unfeasible to to how long it takes to train the model, â‰ˆ10 games per minute * > 600s of games > 1hour per parameter.
